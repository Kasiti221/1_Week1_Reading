Problem
Consider the following MIPS code fragments, each containing two instructions. For each code fragment identify the type of hazard that exists between the two instructions and the registers involved.
a.
LD	R1, 0(R2)
DADD R3, R1, R2
b.
MULT R1, R2, R3
DADD R1, R2, R3
c.
MULT R1, R2, R3
MULT R4, R5, R6
d.
DADD R1, R2, R3
SD	2000(R0), R1
e.
DADD R1, R2, R3
SD	2000(R1), R4



Solution
a.	RAW: add requires the value of R1 returned by ld
b.	WAW: add modifies the value of R1 that is also computed by mul
c.	structural hazard for multiplier
d.	RAW: sd requires (in MEM stage) the value of R1 computed by add
e.	RAW: sd requires (in ALU stage) the value of R1 computed by add
