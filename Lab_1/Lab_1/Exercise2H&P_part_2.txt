Situation where the optimization can't be applied: 

LOAD Rx, 0(Rb) -> Load value from memory addressed by Rb into Rx
Add Ry, Ry, Rx -> Add Rx to Ry and store in Ry
STORE Rx, 0(Rc) -> Store the value in Rx to memory addressed by Rc

Reason:
The loaded value in Rx is needed only for the ADD operation but also for the subsequent STORE operation.
If we replaced the first two instructions with ADD Ry, 0(Rb), we would lose the value that needs to be store in the third instruction.
