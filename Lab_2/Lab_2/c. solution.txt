Understanding the problem first. 

loop: LD R1,0(R2)      # Load value from the memory address in R2 into R1
      DADDI R1,R1,1    # Increment the value in R1 by 1
      SD 0(R2),R1      # Store the updated valaue from R1 back to address in R2
      DADDI R2,R2,4    # Increment R2 by 4 (moving to next memory word)
      DSUB R4,R3,R2    # R4 = R3-R2 (checking if we're done)
      BNEZ R4,loop     # Branch to loop if R4 ≠ 0.

So, let's start with the assumptions. 
   1. It's a 5-stage pipeline with normal forwarding.
   2. Single-cycle delayed branch. 
 => We can reorder instructions and modify operands.

Optimizing instruction sequence.
  => The delayed branch slot provides the optimization opportunity. 
  The instruction after BNEZ will always execute. 
  The best candidate is the DADDI R2, R2, 4 instruction since:  
     - It doesn't depend on the branch outcome. 
     - It can be moved without affectin gprogram correctness. 
     - It's independent of other instructions in the loop.

Reordered code: 
  loop: LD R1,0(R2)     # Load value at address in R2 into R1
      DADDI R1,R1,1     # Increment the value R1 by 1
      SD 0(R2),R1       # Store the value R1 back to address in R2
      DSUB R4,R3,R2     # R4 = R3-R2 (check if we're done)
      BNEZ R4,loop      # Branch to loop if R4 ≠ 0
      DADDI R2,R2,4     # Increment the value R2 by 4 (in delay slot)

Let's create a pipeline diagram analysis.

  Cycle 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12
  LD    IF  ID  EX  ME  WB
  DADDI     IF  ID  --  EX  ME  WB  # 1 stall for load-use hazard
  SD            IF  ID  EX  ME  WB
  DSUB              IF  ID  EX  ME  WB
  BNEZ                  IF  ED  EX  ME  WB
  DADDI                     IF  ID  EX  ME  WB  # Delay slot
  LD                            IF  ID  EX  ME  WB  # Next iteration

Cycles per iteration. 
    First LD starts at cycle 1.
    Next LD starts at cycle 7
    Each iteration takes 6 cycles

Calculating the total execution time. 
  We process 396/4 => 99 elements. 
  99 iterations × 6 cycles = 594 cycles
  For the final iteration, we need to complete all 6 instructions: 6 cycles
  Total Cycles: 594 + 6 = 600 cycles
